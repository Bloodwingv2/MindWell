# üåü Overview

Ever wondered if your data is safe or not? Ever wondered how much of your data you are actually unknowingly giving to chat applications on the internet? No???? click at this article below:

<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0573lj172jo" target="_blank">
  <img width="600" height="400" alt="Meta AI article" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/710a0638-cc7c-4693-bbb4-043b2d39bbed" />

If you read the article your reaction is probably like this right now 

<img width="400" height="300" alt="aww-hell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b250dda-e09c-4c8a-97e5-71e5cecd16fc" />

<br>

Well, I have some good news for you!! , Google's recent high performance `Gemma3n model` is the answer for all your therapeutic needs! Instead of asking ChatGPT or other AI tools for therapy, why not ask **MindWell**? Your very own offline AI desktop app where you are in control of your data and you can `analyze` and `journal` your `special memories`, and view your `progress` over time.

## The Magic Behind MindWell

All of this is possible thanks to a lightweight model from Google called **"Gemma 3n"**.

Gemma 3n is truly one of a kind! You know how models create better responses based on the parameters they have? Well, Gemma 3n is unique in this case - it has a footprint of 5B parameters but operates with the memory capacity of only 2B (in the case of e2b), allowing us to create a desktop application with **2 instances of the model** when required for internal calls with much less memory and utilize the TTL mechanisims of Ollama to auto-kill the instance when in-active creating a smooth experience for the entire Desktop application itself:

- üìù **Summarization**
- üí¨ **Chat**  
- üìä **Tracking**
- üìî **Journaling**

**All at once!!!** How awesome is that??

## üõ† Key Components

### Custom NSIS Installer

![MindWell Installer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790d84b0-ceb1-482d-866f-44bb3430fe18)

A fully configured NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) installer bundles the entire Electron app along with required binaries. It handles:

- Offline installation of MindWell
- Offline installation of Ollama

### Integrated Terminal (xterm.js)

![Terminal Download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab935c9-bdb7-4233-ab2a-12ee7263e2d3)

Leveraging terminal emulation via:

- `@xterm/xterm ^5.5.0` ‚Äì Provides the core terminal interface
- `@xterm/addon-fit ^0.10.0` ‚Äì Auto-resizes terminal to fit container

These libraries allow for an embedded terminal that displays real-time model downloads (e.g., `ollama pull gemma:3n`) during first launch.

### Bundled Ollama Installer

- The Ollama binary is pre-packaged within the app's `resources/` directory
- If not already installed, it runs immediately after Mindwell installation during setup
- Post-install, Ollama auto-updates and manages local models efficiently

## üß† First-Time Setup Flow

1. App launches with embedded terminal
2. Checks for ollama binary and gemma:3n model
3. If missing, silently installs Ollama
4. Runs:
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma:3n
   ```
5. User sees progress and status via in-app terminal

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Offline-ready** and installer-integrated
- **Terminal transparency** for initial first-time setups and download 
- **Seamless first-time** AI model provisioning
- **Supports auto-updating** of Ollama in background via Ollama itself
  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**:  
If the integrated terminal fails to open due to new Ollama updates, manually pull the required model using **CMD**:

```cmd
ollama pull gemma3n:e2b
```

## The Star of the Show
A special recognition goes to the **Google Gemma 3n Team** for creating something truly extraordinary. The innovation achieved in these models is nothing short of jaw-dropping:

- **Blazing Performance** ‚Äì The response times and memory efficiency make the application feel incredibly fast and responsive
- **Exceptional Quality** ‚Äì The model's output quality and reasoning capabilities are remarkable for a local deployment
- **Multi-Modal Vision** ‚Äì The multi-modal capabilities make this model genuinely one-of-a-kind in the local AI space

*Note: While Ollama hasn't yet updated to support the full multi-modal capabilities of Gemma 3n, working with what's currently available has been an absolute pleasure.*

## Final Thoughts

This hackathon has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Building with cutting-edge AI technology, exploring the boundaries of what's possible with local models, and creating something meaningful in such a short timeframe has been both challenging and exhilarating.

**Thank you for this amazing opportunity** ‚Äì it's experiences like these that remind me why I fell in love with software development in the first place.
