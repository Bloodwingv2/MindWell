## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a monorepo-like structure, with the frontend, backend, and Electron code all managed within a single repository.

*   **Frontend:** The React application, located in the `electron-app/src/ui` directory, provides the user interface. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to the FastAPI server.
*   **Backend:** The Python-based backend, found in `electron-app/src/Binaries`, is built with FastAPI. It exposes a REST API for the frontend to consume. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, interacting with the AI models, and managing data storage.
*   **Electron:** The Electron application, configured in `electron-app/src/electron`, wraps the frontend and backend into a cohesive desktop experience. It manages the application window, system tray integration, and other native functionalities.
*   **Python-less Virtual Environment:** The Python backend is packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller. This allows the application to run on users' machines without requiring them to have Python installed. The `backend.bat` script is used to launch the Python server in the development environment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get MindWell up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gemmatalk.git
    cd Gemmatalk/electron-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the React development server, the Electron application, and the Python backend concurrently.

## üì¶ Build and Distribution

To build the application for production and create installers for different operating systems, use the following commands:

*   **Build for Windows:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist:win
    ```

*   **Build for macOS:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist:mac
    ```

*   **Build for Linux:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist:linux
    ```

The distributable files will be located in the `electron-app/dist` directory.

##  Work Done in Stages

The development of MindWell was carried out in several stages:

1.  **Electron Setup:** The initial phase involved setting up the basic Electron application structure, including the main and preload scripts.
2.  **Frontend Development:** The user interface was built using React and TypeScript. Different components were created for each feature, such as the `MoodSummarizer`, `GoalSetter`, and `WellnessTracker`.
3.  **Backend Development:** The FastAPI backend was developed to handle the application's logic. This included creating API endpoints for the frontend, integrating with the Ollama and LangChain libraries for AI functionality, and setting up the data storage.
4.  **Electron Builder and NSIS:** The application was packaged for distribution using Electron Builder. A custom NSIS script (`installer-script.nsi`) was created to customize the Windows installer.
5.  **Python-less Packaging:** The Python backend was packaged into a standalone executable to create a "python-less" environment, making it easy for users to run the application without any complex setup.
6.  **Icon and Branding:** The application's icon and branding were designed to create a unique identity for MindWell.
